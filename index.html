    <!-- <h1>Chinese Chess (Dumb)</h1>
    <p>
      This is a functional game of chinese chess (and very DUMB graphic).
      Here's some explanation for the notations:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The positions on the board is represented by a row number (1-10)
          followed by a rank letter (A-I).
        </li>
        <li>
          The pieces are denoted by players team connected with the starting letter of the
          relevant type (Rook, kNight, Cannon, Elephant, Guard, King, Pawn).
        </li>
        <li>
          A move is represented by writing the start position followed by the end position.
          For example, "03B03E" moves player 1's cannon from 03B to the center on that row(03E).
          [ps: Lowercase and uppercase letters can be used interchangeably in move notation.]
        </li>
        <li>
          To make a move, put the notation of your desired move in the input box and press the button.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Have fun!
